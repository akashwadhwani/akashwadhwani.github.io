The beauty of computer programming is that you do not need to formally go to school to learn how to program. You can learn almost everything that you would need to know online, and for free. 

This visualisation was created using **python** which turns video files into ‘barcodes’ where vertical lines represent the average colour of individual frames. It works by taking average of RGB values of every pixel in a single frame of the video in a png file, the process is repeated for all the frames until the barcode is generated.

This project focuses on various music industries in the world and compares the colours used in the most popular music videos in 2018 on YouTube, the generated barcodes are arranged according to the YouTube charts ranking.

Comparing them side by side helps understand the colour and entertainment culture of the popular countries like **India, South Korea, United States, United Kingdom.** 

The colour palette significantly change with the location, as the most popular video in South Korea is fairly brighter than the most popular video in all the other comparing countries. Colours used in India’s videos are more vibrant than others, as in United States's the most popular video has a dark colour palette, videos in UK follow almost same pattern as United States.
