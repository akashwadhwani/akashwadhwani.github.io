**British Red Cross X London College of Communication: MA Data Visualisation**

This project was a collaboration with British Red Cross, as they partnered with our course at UAL. 

The project is about how a migrant moves in North Africa and what all problems it faces on daily basis. We focused on a very small place in North Africe called Mali and a city in Mali called "Bamako".

We focus on 4 different real life stories of the migrants and the difficult choices they had to make when they were in stuck while migrating. 

It is an interactive piece where the user plays the role of an immigrant and makes the difficult life choices as the immigrant has to make and see how long can you last!
