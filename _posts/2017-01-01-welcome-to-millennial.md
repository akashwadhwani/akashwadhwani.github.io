**Zero Waste, No hunger?**

500 million small farms worldwide, most still rainfed, provide up to 80 per cent of food consumed in a large part of the developing world. Investing in smallholder women and men is an important way to increase food security and nutrition for the poorest, as well as food production for local and global markets. If women farmers had the same access to resources as men, the number of hungry in the world could be reduced by up to 150 million. Agriculture is the single largest employer in
the world, providing livelihoods for 40 percent of todayâ€™s global population. It is the largest source of income and jobs for poor rural households.

## Getting Started
The idea was to use the warning labels like on cigarette boxes to seek awareness of the users, regarding the food waste and it's consquences. People are wasting food and it is **bad**. This project was to spread facts about wastage of food in a warning manner!

## Inspiration

Cigarette boxes and tobacco companies.
