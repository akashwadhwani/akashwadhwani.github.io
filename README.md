# Introduction

Welcome to the collection of my projects.
It is a small pages website using github to demostrate my work done in the field of visual story telling.

## Theme used

Millennial is a minimalist Jekyll theme for running a simple, clean, content-focused publishing platform for your publication site or blog through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), or on your own server. Everything that you will ever need to know about this Jekyll theme is included in the README below, which you can also find in [the demo site](https://lenpaul.github.io/Millennial/).
